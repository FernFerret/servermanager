### Installing

To install the Sexy Server Manager, simply type:

```
$ hg clone servermanager

$ cd servermanager

$ pip install -r snakefile
```

**Note:** You may need `sudo` to install the server manager:

```
$ sudo pip install -r snakefile
```

### Running

Right now, the SSM is in development and does not yet have the hooks to run as a service (WSGI).

You can start it up in a screen session by running the bash script in the tools folder


### First Run

Once you've started it up, simply login with steam.
The first user who logs in will become an administrator
and can add other users.

After this, you're on your own for now, until I feel
like writing more documentation...
